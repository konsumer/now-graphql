# now-graphql

This used to be a [vercel builder](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/deployments/builders/overview/) for graphql services. There have been some changes to how that works, so I moved to another format for my own projects, so this serves as a simple demo-project. 

## usage

Edit files in `src/` to include your resolvers (.js) and typedefs (.graphql)

* Run a local dev-server with `npm start`
* Deploy with `npm run deploy` to send it to vercel.
